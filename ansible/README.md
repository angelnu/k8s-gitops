# Ansible setup

My cluster is made of a mix of arm64 and x86_64 nodes:
- [production](hosts-production)
- [test](hosts)

The test cluster is created with lxd

## Settings

See [groups_var](groups_var/all.yaml).

Secrets encrypted with [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html). Password stored at `~/.vault_pass.txt` as comfigured at [ansible.cfg](ansible.cfg). This is the only password that needs to be remembered. All other passwords are derived from this.

If a password needs to be changed use the command `ansible-vault encrypt_string` from this folder - it will ask to enter the content to string and end with ctrd-d.
